This is a copy of the following FreeSurfer folder: /Applications/freesurfer/7.1.1/subjects/fsaverage, in which (i) a bunch of unnecessary files for the purpose of this repository are removed, and (ii) some additional files have been added, e.g. to the label folder, such as some Schaefer parcellation related files FreeSurfer5.3/fsaverage/label [assumed that fsaverage surface files of FreeSurfer 5.3 are not different from that of FreeSurfer 7.1.1]. This lightweight version of the fsavergae folder is used in several functions, e.g. hb_aparcfsavg2subj.sh
